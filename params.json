{"name":"Simon JS","tagline":"A Simple Monitor Single Page Application","body":"### Welcome to Simon JS.\r\nSimon JS is a Single Page Application that helps you monitor the status of your development infrastructure. \r\n\r\nIt is meant as a tool to help developers gain a quick overview and easy access to build jobs on applications like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/), software quality projects on tools like [Sonarqube](http://www.sonarqube.org/) and services on infrastructure monitoring tools like [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/).\r\n\r\n### How does Simon JS work?\r\nSimon JS is a Single Page Application using JavaScript to get remote data and display it on the page. It's based on AMD/[Require JS](http://requirejs.org/) uses [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) for view rendering, [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and frontent effects. While Simon JS is written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), the Simon JS library is distributed in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nData from backend servers is loaded as JSON, applied to JavaScript models which are in turn displayed on the page using Knockout.\r\nThe data is reloaded periodically (currently every 60-120 seconds). Thanks to Knockout's two way data binding, the page is seamlessly updated with new data.\r\n\r\n### How does Simon JS look like?\r\nA fully configured page for a development team consisting of Jenkins jobs, Sonar projects and Nagios hosts looks like this:\r\n`<insert full page picture here>`\r\n\r\nJenkins Job\r\n`<insert job pictures with different status here (ok, unstable, disabled, building, show details, ...)>`\r\n\r\nSonar\r\n`<insert sonar table pictures here>`\r\n\r\nNagios\r\n`<insert host pictures with different status here (ok, warning, broken, show details)>`\r\n\r\n### How do use Simon JS?\r\n`<insert full description here>`\r\n- open page from `http://www.simonjs.org/.../index.html`\r\n- supply your own configuration using URL parameter \"config\":\r\n`http://www.simonjs.org/.../index.html?config=http://your-server/config.js`\r\n\r\n- Simon JS is configured using a JSON object stored in a global variable \"configJson\":\r\n`configJson={}`\r\n- The configuration object must be compatible to the Typescript interface `https://github.com/afranken/simon/blob/master/src/main/ts/jsonInterfaces/Config.d.ts`\r\n- When you open `http://www.simonjs.org/.../index.html`, a sample configuration is used that can be found here: `http://www.simonjs.org/.../config.js`\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
